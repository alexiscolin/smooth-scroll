# smooth-scroll
Simple smooth scrolling and parallaxe module based on fake scroll events (aka wheel and touch and keyPress...).

## Getting Started
Made as a prototype reveal based class, initialize the module to use it.

``` javascript
import { SmoothScroll } from 'smooth-scroll';
let smoothscroll = new SmoothScroll({
  parallax: true,
  delay: .1,
  speed: .8,
  touchSpeed: 2,
 Â jump: 120
});
```
## Options and Settings
### parallax
* ```true```: enable parallax on scroll from parallax module
